## [Music](https://music.willbc.cn)
[Beethoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven) made me get through the hard days which is the reason I felt in love with classical music and started learning piano. I like the immersion and self-expression while playing piano, it's an active soul which is made by the composer and player across time and space.

I'm also interested in Rock Music because of [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure), you should definitely check it.



## [Book](https://book.willbc.cn)
Novel is my favorite since childhood. I started writing Chinese poetry, prose and short stories for personal expression since 2010. [Jean-Christophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Christophe) effects me a lot, I have thoughts about writing a novel relative to it.

Check [book.willbc.cn](https://book.willbc.cn) if you can read Chinese.
